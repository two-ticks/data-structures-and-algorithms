# Data Structures and Algorithms

main memory -> RAM


database â†’ HDD


data warehouse 

heap : dynamic

stack : till program ends 

- time complexity : how time grows with size of input
O -> 'order of' 

  slower step decides the order

  O(1) -> constant time irrespective of input

  O(n) -> most impactful term is of nth order or linear 

  Big O : `A function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) iff there exists a constant c and n_o such that 0<=f(n)<=cg(n) for n>=n_o`
